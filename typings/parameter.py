If you feedback a Bullet Solver CHOP that has no change to the channel values in it, the simulation will act as normal as nothing is being overriden. This allows you do things like the example below. 

For example, to negate the velocity of every actor in a simulation you could use a Bullet Solver CHOP, put that into a Switch CHOP with the second input being the same CHOP only with the velocity channels negated. Then export a button pulse to the switch index and put the Switch CHOP into the Feedback CHOP parameter. Then, when the button is pressed for a single frame (pulsed) the velocities will be overridden and negated.  

The only channels required to feedback are the actor_id and body_id channels, all other channels are optional. The channel names should all be the same as in the Bullet Solver CHOP.

:FOV = arctan( 0.5 *  (screenWidth / distanceToScreen) ) *  2

:FOV = arctan(0.5 / Throw) *  2			



'''FOV calculations in x and y'''



The above equations can be used to determine FOV_x and FOV_y (ie. horizontally and vertically) using Comera COMP parameters focal and aperture. In TouchDesigner's Camera COMP, screenWidth = aperture parameter and distanceToScreen = focal parameter (assuming infinity focus), from this 

:FOV_x = arctan( (aperture / 2) / focal) *  2



Furthermore, as mentioned above aperture parameter = aperture_x and if given the resolution in x and y of the rendered view (ie. aspect ratio)

:aperture_y = resy/resx *  aperture_x

	transparency : renderTOPtransparencyMenu

For every pixel the closest surface is rendered in the first pass, the second closest surface second, up to the number of passes specified by the <span class='tipTextTOP'>Transparency Passes</span> parameter below. Turning this option on will disable some advanced features in the Render TOP, as well as anti-aliasing.		

				

The feature is a pixel-based approach, not object-based. So its performance is not directly related to the number of objects, but rather how they are layered.				

				

It uses a technique called Depth Peeling. First you render the normal frame. On your next render you peel away all of the pixels you saw in the first frame, and reveal the pixels underneath them. The next frame you do the same, peeling away the pixels you could see from the 2nd render. And so on. Once all of the renders are done, you re composite each layer Over the other, starting at the farthest back layer.				

				

If you take a sphere for example, you'll need to do 2 passes, the first one for the front of the sphere, and then 2nd will be the inside of the sphere.				

				

If you have 10 spheres, one behind the other. You'll need 19-20 passes to get the correct image.				

				

If you have 10 spheres, each next to each other across the screen, you'll only need 2 passes.				

				

In reality though you will only need 3-5 passes to get an image that's acceptable. It may not be 100% correct, but it'll look pretty close to correct.				

				

Each pass is a full render, so each pass adds significant overhead."""

This parameter enables rendering depth-peels, but without combining all the layers using blending to create order independent transparency. Instead is keeps all the layers separate and they can be retrieved using a [[Render Select TOP]]. Depth peeling is done by first rendering rendering geometry normally and saving that image and depth. Then another render is done but the closest pixels that were occluded by the previous pass are written to the color buffer instead. This can be done multiple times, each time peeling back farther into the scene. If you are rendering a sphere the first render will be the outside of the sphere, and the second peel layer will be the back-inside of the sphere."""

From the perspective of digital audio, a signal level which varies between '+1 <-> -1' is at a volume level of '0' decibels, because it is not possible for a digital system to respresent any values larger than '+1 <-> -1'.  Instead, they will simply be clipped as they proceed to the output device.

For example, after an excessively loud tone burst, the limiter's gain may have been pushed up to an extreme value. This extreme value will take a long time to be fully released.

*  Segment – each segment acts as one timer, with delay time, length, number of cycles to repeat and other conditions.			

*  Begin – in Parallel Timers, the number of seconds after a Start (frames or samples) after which each timer starts counting up from zero.			

*  Done – The state it goes into when all the timers has finished counting, whether they are in Parallel or Serial, Segments or not.			

*  End – Cycle End is the end of each cycle, Segment End is the end of the segment.			

*  Cumulative Time – Zero at Start, a count that is affected by speed and rises while timers are active (not during delays).			

*  Running Time – Zero at Start, the wall-clock time since Start was called no matter what are the delays, speeds, cycles or premature clicking of Go To Segment End. It stops counting when Done has been reached."""

This weights point 0 to three regions (actually only two because the first entry has a weight of zero).

 0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 2.0			

			

This causes the first entry to be ignored (a weighting of 2.0 is used).

Not all geometry can be converted to specific types. For example, a triangulated polygon surface to a single NURBS surface, or a Mesh sphere into a primitive sphere. Also, certain conversions will preserve shapes. For example, converting a Bzier curve to a NURBS curve or a polygonal mesh to a NURBS Surface.

'''Trimmed Surface Notes''': If the primitive to be converted is a curve (NURBS or Bezier) and is flat, a trimmed surface will be generated such that the visible piece coincides with the curve. If the curve is not flat, it will be converted to a non-trimmed surface. The advantage of the trimmed solution is that it yields a very clean surface and handles concave curves perfectly."""

	roll : FloatPar
	"""Float : The Strength of the effect being applied. The Rolloff determines an accentuation of the effect being applied. When you are using different types of transformations this Strength / Roll will have different effects:	

		

*  Bend - Strength and Roll are used to control the extremities of the geometry (try a value of 0.5).	

*  Twist - Strength and Roll are used to affect the twist amount based on the distance.		

*  Shear - Strength and Roll are used to affect the shear amount based on distance.		

*  Taper - Strength and Roll are used to affect the direction of the bow (inwards vs. outwards).		

*  Linear Taper - Strength and Roll have no effect for this option.		

*  Squash and Stretch - Strength and Roll are used to maintain the apparent volume of the source geometry.		

		

Typically, Rolloff should equal ```1</code> - which spreads the effect evenly (although not being limited to) across the bounds of the geometry. Values higher than <code>1</code> iterate the effect multiple times through the same range. If Rolloff equals <code>0```, then the effect may be localised to a small segment at the centre of the deformed geometry and Strength may not appear to work properly.
